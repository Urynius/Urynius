👋 Hi, I’m Oskar Chrapka, a programming student from Poland.
👀 I’m interested in web development, AI, and open-source projects.
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, and exploring the latest trends.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web apps, machine learning projects, and anything exciting in tech!
⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, I stay in my g... cave.
